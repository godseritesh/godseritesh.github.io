```typescript
// Imports
import { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// Types (if needed)
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string;
}

// Component
export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ title }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);

  return (
    <motion.div>
      {title}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
